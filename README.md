# My Apps
Starting from late 2016, I started mobile app development in my spare time. <del>Sadly, it is not considered as working experience and often ignored. That's why I am still struggling to find a job.</del> I had many ideas but unfortunately, I did not have enough time to do them all because of my uni work. I even failed some courses because I spent too much time making my own apps. Luckily, I found a balance between uni and my own project later and have graduated from uni successfully. I have learnt many things from the development process. It is not only about programming but more than them.

## Native IOS
### [WoWs Info Original](https://github.com/HenryQuan/WoWs_Info_Original)
This is my 'first ever' app written in Swift 2 - 3. It is really messy and I find it amazing that it even works. However, it has been acheived but it is better than what I have been working on recently. When you only focus on one platform, that's when it shrines.

### [Legacy](https://github.com/HenryQuan/Legacy)
This includes some of my early IOS projects. They were written in Objective-C and some were challeneing for me back then. However, I never gave up unlike now. I always pushed to my absolute limit. I want to go back and be like that once more.

### Availability
This was never published on AppStore because it wasn't working properly and I gave up sonn after that. It was about testing whether certain websites were accessible or not. I remember it didn't work for ipv6 addresses.

## Native Android
### [AnimeBoard](https://github.com/HenryQuan/AnimeBoard)
This can be considered as my first ever Android app. It is a mobile client of certain website and when I have time, I will update it with more features. Android development is still quite challenging for me.

### [WordList](https://github.com/HenryQuan/MyWordList)
This app was meant to copy any words you don't know and save into a plain text file to be imported into Quizlet later.

### [CPUSpeed](https://github.com/HenryQuan/CPUSpeed)
Change CPU frequency for rooted Android devices. It doesn't really work on all devices and I might update it later.

### [SendText](https://github.com/HenryQuan/SendText-to-PC)
Send text from your android phone to your desktop. However, now I use discord more and it can be really useful sometimes.

## React Native
### [WoWs Info RE](https://github.com/HenryQuan/WoWs-Info-Re)
WoWs Info but with React Native. I am still working this project but I need to do something else I think.

### [AnimeGo](https://github.com/HenryQuan/AnimeGo)
A mobile client for a certain website. I rarely use it now but It might improve when I have time.

### [Memo](https://github.com/HenryQuan/Memo)
It was meant to copy OnePlus' note app but it didn't work that well.

## Flutter

## Xamarin

## Ionic
