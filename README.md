# My Apps
Starting from late 2016, I started mobile app development in my spare time. <del>Sadly, it is not considered as working experience and often ignored. That's why I am still struggling to find a job.</del> I had many ideas but unfortunately, I did not have enough time to do them all because of my uni work. I even failed some courses because I spent too much time making my own apps. Luckily, I found a balance between uni and my own project later and have graduated from uni successfully. I have learnt many things from the development process. It is not only about programming but more than them.

## Native IOS
### [WoWs Info Original](https://github.com/HenryQuan/WoWs_Info_Original)
This is my 'first ever' app written in Swift 2 - 3. It is really messy and I find it amazing that it even works. However, it has been acheived but it is better than what I have been working on recently. When you only focus on one platform, that's when it shrines.

### [Legacy](https://github.com/HenryQuan/Legacy)
This includes some of my early IOS projects. They were written in Objective-C and some were challeneing for me back then. However, I never gave up unlike now. I always pushed to my absolute limit. I want to go back and be like that once more.

### Availability
This was never published on AppStore because it wasn't working properly and I gave up sonn after that. It was about testing whether certain websites were accessible or not. I remember it didn't work for ipv6 addresses.
